<p>One annoyance when using R is the need to re-install packages with each new installation of R. This is a method to avoid this (at least on unix-like systems), but make sure you use the R command</p>

<p><code>r
update.packages()
</code>
regularly. The first step is to make a directory where you plan to install the libraries. I choose the home directory <code>~/</code> and name my directory <code>Rlibs</code>. To do this, open the terminal and type</p>

<p><code>bash
mkdir ~/Rlibs
</code>
Then, go to your home directory (by typing <code>cd</code>) and create a new file (<code>.Renviron</code>) that R will use to set environment variables using emacs by typing</p>

<p><code>bash
emacs .Renviron
</code>
opening the file using the <code>emacs</code> text editor. Then type</p>

<p><code>bash
R_LIBS=~/Rlibs
</code>
to tell R that packages should be installed and loaded from the <code>~/Rlibs</code> directory. To save the <code>.Renviron</code> file, use the emacs command for save</p>

<p><code>bash
ctrl-x ctrl-s
</code>
where, while holding the <code>ctrl</code> key you type <code>x</code> then <code>s</code>. Then exit emacs using</p>

<p><code>bash
ctrl-x ctrl-c
</code>
If at anytime you are unsure, just hit <code>esc</code> a few times to clear out the <code>emacs</code> buffer. Make sure to use <code>update.packages()</code> often in R to keep the libraries up to date.</p>
