```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

You can also include inline equations like $Y = X \beta + \epsilon$ or inset equations using `\begin{align} Y\_{t} = \phi Y\_{t-1} + \epsilon\_{t} \end{align}` to get

\begin{align}
Y\_{t} = \phi Y\_{t-1} + \epsilon\_{t}
\end{align}

or by typing `$$Y\_{t} = \phi Y\_{t-1} + \epsilon\_{t}$$` to get

$$
Y\_{t} = \phi Y\_{t-1} + \epsilon\_{t}
$$

Note that to get the underscore character `_` to render a subscript properly, you need to use the command `\_` in markdown to use markdown's escape mechanism. This means to get $Y\_{t}$ to render, type `Y\_{t}`.
