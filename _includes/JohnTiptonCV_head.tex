%Now that I am at the end of my graduate education, I am looking for
%opportunities to continue developing and learning. The postdoc position
%through the NSF and STATMOS studying spatial extremes applied to
%climate data is exactly the project I want.  I am well qualified for a project
%studying extreme weather events for the purpose of improving hurricane forecasting
%models. I have studied extreme value  statistics with Dr. Dan Cooley
%and have a strong background of computational and spatial
%statistics. Based on these research interests, I will make an
%impactful contribution to this work. 
%
%
%In my young research career, I have produced quality
%research using statistical modeling techniques to answer a number of
%scientific questions using spatio-temporal and computational statistics. Recent projects include: 
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item A mechanistic, multiscale model for reconstruction of late
%  Holocene joint temperature and precipitation from tree ring width
%  data. 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item ASA ENVR 2015 student paper award.
%\end{itemize}
%\item A spatio-temporal reconstruction of early 1800's temperature in
%  the Upper Midwestern United States from sparse historical
%  temperature records. 
%\item A reconstruction of water depth from assemblages of testate
%  Amoeba species data in peat bogs. 
%\end{itemize}
%
%For each project I developed novel models to meet
%the needs of the data. I  conducted simulation studies to evaluate model
%performance,  wrote MCMC samplers in C++ and R, and explored
%spatio-temporal models that incorporate dimension reduction,
%regularization, restriced spatial regression, Gaussian Markov Random
%Fields, and improved computational methods.
%
%I am an excellent collaborator, having received awards for my
%consulting, and thrive in an interdisciplinary team environment. I
%worked on projects for PalEON, the US Forest Service, and the US
%National Park Service. I know because of my statistical background
%and history of working with other scientists, I can make a
%contribution to this project studying the spatial extremes of climate
%data.
I am a well qualified candidate for your postdoc project
studying extreme weather events for the purpose of improving hurricane forecasting
models. In addition to several courses on Bayesian statistics taught
be Drs. Hoeting and Hooten as well as time series, sampling and survey
statistics by Drs. Opsomer and Breidt, I also took a graduate level
course on extreme value statistics with Dr. Dan Cooley
and have a strong background of computational and spatial
statistics. Based on these research interests, I will make an
immediate and meaningful contribution to this work. 

In my research career, I have produced quality
research using statistical modeling techniques to answer a number of
scientific questions using spatio-temporal and computational
statistics and I am defending my dissertation on this research in late August. Recent projects include: 

\begin{itemize}
\item A mechanistic, multiscale model for reconstruction of late
  Holocene joint temperature and precipitation from tree ring width
  data. 
\begin{itemize}
\item ASA ENVR 2015 student paper award.
\end{itemize}
\item A spatio-temporal reconstruction of early 1800's temperature in
  the Upper Midwestern United States from sparse historical
  temperature records. 
\item A reconstruction of water depth from assemblages of Testate
  Amoeba species data in peat bogs. 
\end{itemize}

For each project I developed novel models to meet
the needs of the data. I  conducted simulation studies to evaluate model
performance,  wrote MCMC samplers in C++ and R, and explored
spatio-temporal models that incorporate dimension reduction,
regularization and model selection, restricted spatial regression, Gaussian Markov Random
Field techniques, and improved computation within a Bayesian
hierarchical model framework.

I am an excellent collaborator, having received awards for my
consulting, and I thrive in an interdisciplinary team environment. I
have collaborated with many research groups and government agencies
including PalEON, the US Forest Service, and the US National Park
Service. Because of my statistical background and history working with 
other scientists, I can make a contribution to this project studying
the spatial extremes of climate data.
