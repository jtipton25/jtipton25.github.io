I am a Postdoctoral research student in statistics at Colorado State University. I work on developing statistical methodology for the environmental and ecological sciences, with a focus on Bayesian methods, predictive validation, development of mechanistic models, and statistical computing. My current research is with the [PalEON project](http://www3.nd.edu/~paleolab/paleonproject/).
